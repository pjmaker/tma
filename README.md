# tma

A time series data analysis display and analysis tool orginally
designed for reporting on power systems. One application is 
within the ASIM modelling framework (http://git.com/ThinkOfaNumber/ASIM).
Its typically used to:

* Display real time data which is normally timestamped rather than 
sampled at a fixed rate.
* Analyse and generate new time series, e.g. a value smoothed with
a ramp filter.
* And to generate PDF based reports of the final results, typically
for archival.

All of the above are scriptable in TCL (http://wiki.tcl.tk).
